++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You can find the PDF and TeX files `here <http://kskedlaya.org/geometryunbound/>`__.
A good free book of geometry for students interested in national or international
mathematical competitions, but it might be useful for others.
Short, with nice explanations, and with a good treatment of some "classic" techniques like *angle-chasing*.
It will teach you a lot, but you have to be willing to expend some effort on the exercises.
Assumes proeficiency with Algebra.
Sadly, it contains no figures, but you can often draw them yourself from the text.

*In a mad world, all blogging is psychiatry blogging.*
A very ecletic blog, featuring book reviews, discussions of statistics, psychiatry,
healthcare, social justice discussions and much more.
Don't miss the occasional short story. The're great.

Will add some highlights soon.

shtetloptimized.com
+++++++++++++++++++

Link `here <http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/>`__.
A blog by *the other Scott* (Scott Aaronson).
Focuses on complexity theory research, with occasional forays into other themes, such as philosophy.
It is often very tachnical, but he is good with analogies, and will at least fool you
into thinking you understand some of that stuff.

Scott Aaronson has also written
`Who Can Name the Biggest Number? <http://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/bignumbers.html>`_

Lesswrong
+++++++++

This is the one of the sites that started the whole Rationalist movement.
Content quality is in my opinion somewhat variable, but it might be just
a result of the *Typical Mind Fallacy* (see below).
Some highlights:

`The True Prisoner Dilemma <http://lesswrong.com/lw/tn/the_true_prisoners_dilemma/>`_, by Eliezer Yudkowsky.
This is the explanation of the `Prisoner Dilemma <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma>`_
that I've been missing my whole life.
Eliezer argues in a very convincing way that most people have an incorrect understading of the classic prisoner dilemma.
That is, their intuition doesn't match the mathematical discription.
By contriving a very unlikely situation, Eliezer manages to fore our intuition to match the utility
caculations in the payoff matrix.
Bonus points for `this exchange <http://lesswrong.com/lw/tn/the_true_prisoners_dilemma/#display_t1_n0i>`_
in the comments.
Robin Hanson, a University Professor
and one of the athors at `Overcoming Bias <http://www.overcomingbias.com/>`_
says that:

  Most every game theory text and lecture I know gets this right,
  but even when we say the right thing to students over and over,
  they mostly still hear it the wrong way you initially heard it.
  This is just part of the facts of life of teaching game theory.

Thus missing the point completely: if his students are "hearing it wrong",
maybe the teacher is *not explaining it right*, and thus the need for a better 
visualization of the payoff matrix.
Eliezer attempts to provide such visualization instead of asserting that
having students confused at the end of the lesson is a *fact of life*.
In my opinion, he succeeds.


**The Typical Mind Fallacy**, introduced in
`Generalizing from One Example <http://lesswrong.com/lw/dr/generalizing_from_one_example/>`_,
by Yvain (this guy reminds me of Scott Alexander... I wonder why).
He argues that people seem to think in fundamentally different ways, and that people who extrapolate
from their own personal experience might be getting everything wrong.
This might be obvious to you, but maybe that's part of the typical mind fallacy.


Webcomics
~~~~~~~~~

`xkcd <https://xkcd.com/>`_ - A series of disjointed comics, featuring some recurrent characters.
Focuses on nerd topics, but some of them might have a wider appeal.
Don't miss the Hat Guy "love story":
Some highlights:

* The cloud
* The hat guy love story:

`SMBC (Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal) <https://www.smbc-comics.com/>`_ - Similar in spirit
to xkcd, but with a different art style.
Heavy focus on nerd topics, with loads of dark humour and sexual jokes. 

`Irregular Webcomic <http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/>`_. A tale of epic proportions
featuring `the Mythbusters <http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/cast/mythbusters.html>`_,
`Indiana Jones and the Nazis <http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/cast/cliffhangers.html>`_ (actually *Monatana Jones*) ,
`Death <http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/cast/death.html>`_,
a `D&M campaign <http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/cast/fantasy.html>`_,
`scientists <http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/cast/scientificrevolution.html>`_,
and `The Author <http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/cast/>`_.
Bonus points for an excelent explanation of the
`Banach-Tarski paradox <http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/2339.html>`_
(not in webcomic form, unfortunately).

`Darths and Droids <http://www.darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0001.html>`_.
What if Star Wars was the result of a Dungeons & Dragons Campaign set in a Science Fiction setting,
and the crazy plot were just the players trying to mess up with the Game Master?
Started in Episode I (*The Phantom Menace*) and is currently in episode VI (*The Return of the Jedi*).
The comic uses only frames from the movies, but "dubbed" with dialog baloons.
The story diverges quite a bit from the original.
It was inspired by `DM of the Rings <http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=612>`_,
which in my opinion is not as good.

Miscellaneous

Gwern's webpage
+++++++++++++++

You can find it `here <https://www.gwern.net/>`__.
Writes about the nature of causality, pharmacology, Bitcoin, fanfiction, etc.
You probably won't be interested in everything in this website,
but there's something for everyone.


Fiction (prose)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Original
++++++++

Scott Alexander
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Unsong <http://unsongbook.com/>`_, a distillation of previous ideas Scott has had for a story.
  Epic in scope, doesn't quite live up to the high expectations of its first strong chapters.
  Very original take on magic systems.
  Has both tragedy and comedy, and overdoses on puns (in a good way).
  Should be credited with the creating of a new kind of pun, the *biblical whale pun*.
  `Please don't call this rational fiction <https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4sv6te/meta_is_unsong_rational_fic/>`_.
  **Mild Spoilers ahead**: The mood changes quite drastically from urban (kabbahlah inspired) fantasy
  with a very strong exploration of an original magic system,
  to full blown very soft unrestrained (kabbahlah inspired) fantasy, complete with Angels, Archangels,
  Demons, Messiahs, and Prophecies.
  In my opinion, this change doesn't work that well.
  Still, quite good.

Several short stories:

* `...And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit Hole Goes <http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/>`_,
  based on a Tumblr post of all things.
  The title is a reference to the first matrix movie.
  In this short story supernatural entity offers some humans a choice among 8 superpowers.
  The world will never again be the same.
  Very good, as long as you don't think toooo much about the plot.
  To really appreciate this, you need to know about
  `the red pill movement <https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/>`_.
  Click the previous link at your own risk.
  
* `A Modern Myth <http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/02/27/a-modern-myth/>`_.
  Probably the best short story Scott has ever written.
  I won't spoil it further.
  Trust me and just read it.

* `World War II <http://squid314.livejournal.com/275614.html>`_.
  World War II from the perspective of the cinema critic.

Alexander Wales
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Glimwarden <http://alexanderwales.com/glimwarden/>`_ (Work in progress, currently in a long hiatus).
  A piece of rational fiction set in an original fantasy world.
  Characters are realistic, and very relatable.
  The atmosphere is very, very good.
  This is reational fiction done right.

* `Wizards <http://alexanderwales.com/the-astronauts-lament/>`_, (short story).
  The colonization of space in a world with magic.
  Good magic system, and some surprises.

I do not recomend `Worm <https://parahumans.wordpress.com/>`_.

Fanfiction
++++++++++

`Metropolitan Man <https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man>`_, by Alexander Wales (finished).
Fanfiction based on Superman, set in the 1930's (when the character appeard in print for the first time).
The story is told from the perspective of a rational (but still paranoid and callous) Lex Luthor and Louis Lane.
The prose in the first paragraphs (maybe the whole first chapter) is not very good...
Keep reading until chapters 3 or 4.
If you don't like it by chapter 4, then quit.
Characters are realistic, and the author really did his historical research on the time period.
Lex Luthor's perspective on the dangers of Superman is engaging, and his schemes are clever and
well thought out.
My favourite (finished) piece of rational fiction.
Unlike the original Superman books, this story is quite dark in places.
Don't tell me I didn't warn you.

`Imma wizerd <http://immawiserd.weebly.com/>`_, Harry Potter gangsta version.
*Extremely* offensive but fun in the beginning.
The fun kinda wears out as you advance into the story.

`Walt Disney Presents: The Lord of the Rings <http://www.lotrfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?sid=9145&chapter=1>`_,
by `jules14 <http://www.lotrfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=1724>`_.
Tries to answer the question: *What if Disney decided to write an animated adaptation of Lord of the Rings?*

I **do not** recommend `Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality <http://www.hpmor.com/>`_.
`This critique <https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/3096lk/spoilers_all_a_critical_review_of_hpmor/>`_
(by Alexander Wales) explains why.
I endorse it 100% up to the experiments on the transfiguration of bats, because that's where I quit.
Alexander Wales is an excellent writer, and I trust his opinion on the parts I didn't read.

Recomended Reading - Deadtree

Fiction
~~~~~~~

Detective Stories
+++++++++++++++++

`Name of the Rose <https://www.amazon.com/Name-Rose-Umberto-Eco/dp/0544176561>`_, by Umberto Ecco.
On the surface, this is a detective story set in the middle ages, where a friar
investigates a series of murders in an Abbey.
On a deeper reading, it's almost a primer on Medieval history, architecture, culture and theology.
Expect that some parts will get a little over your head, unless you're an expert in these things.

More to come...

Science Fiction
+++++++++++++++

*Dune*, by Frank Herbert, is meh.
You don't lose much by not reading it, despite how praised it is.
The following books in the series are really bad.

*Pandora's Star* and *Judas Unchained* (the sequel), by Peter F. Hamilton.
They're long but well written, and the plot is interesting and intrincate.
They'd benefit from cutting some less relevant parts, but as they are they're pretty good.

*Rendezvous with Rama*, by Arthur C. Clark. A first contact story.
Don't expect anything very deep, but the story is well written, even if the characters may be a little flat.
This is understandable, as the story takes place during a very short time span.

*2001 Spacy Odyssey*, by Arthur C. Clark. The book is based on the movie (not the other way around).
The book is interesting and captures the atmosphere and mood of living alone
in a spaceship for long periods, with the communication issues (mostly latency) imposed by the speed of light.

*Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, by Douglas Adams, books 1 and 2. The other books just aren't that funny.
An example of British nonsense humor.

Almost everything by *Jules Verne*. Dated but fun.
Mixes scarily accurate predictions with an almost comical disregard for things like
the laws of thermodynamics, and in more extreme cases, physics in general.
English translations are very bad, though.
The good part is that all the books are now in the public domain.
You can find them on Project Gutenberg.
Some highlights:

* *Around the World in 80 Days*
* *5 weeks in a Baloon*
* *20,000 Leagues Under the sea*
* *The Mysterious Island*
* *From the Earth to the Moon* and *Around the Moon*.
  These two books contain such a mixture between scarily accurate predictions and
  epic physics fails that I'll write a detailed review someday.
  Bonus points for the delightful caricature of the USA mixed with envious admiration.
* *Robur the Conqueror*
* *Michel Strogoff*
* *Hector Servadac*

The `Sandokan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandokan>`_, series, by Emilio Salgari.
The books are good `ole' mighty whighty stories <http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightyWhitey>`_,
even though the main character is actualy a Malaysian prince.
He ends up acting like an ordinary educated european aristocrat most of the time.
Most of the books take place in India, with the characters often remarking that the impact
of the British Raj is mostly positive.

Miscellaneous
+++++++++++++

*Foucault's Pendulum*, by Umberto Ecco - An entertaining story, based on some Medieval myths.
The title is a reference to the Foucault's Pendulum, which is a device that can be used
to prove that the Earth rotates on an axis.

`River God <>`_, Wilbur Smith. Part of a trilogy, books \#2 and \#3 are very bad.
Don't read those.
Set in a highly fictionalized version of Ancient Egypt, this book is practically alternate history.
Nevertheless, it's one of the best books I've read on the impact of technology in society.
The main character is implausibly knowleageable and quite insufferable at times,
but the real main character in this book is technology change, and the way it affects the world.

`Cryptonomicon <https://www.amazon.com/Cryptonomicon-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0060512806>`_, by Neal Stephenson.

`Snow Crash <https://www.amazon.com/Snow-Crash-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0553380958>`_, by Neal Stephenson.
In the near future, when capitalism runs rampant in a world without borders,
or, for that matter, nation states, the Universe assumedly runs on Rule of Cool.
This means physics (or for that matter linguistics or neuroscience) are not as respected as they should be.
It's an interesting story as long as you don't dwell around the details too much.
This is the story that popularized the word *avatar* to refer to a person's online persona
and that inspired the *Google Earth* software.
The name of my webpage is a hommage to a major plot point in this book. 
Features (consensual) sex with an underage character (16yo, if I'm remembering correctly)
as an important plot point, so don't read it if that's a no-go for you.

`Hunt for the Red October <https://www.amazon.com/Hunt-October-Jack-Ryan-Novel/dp/0425240339>`_, by Tom Clancy.
During the Cold War, a Soviet submarine gone rogue causes a worldwide search and destroy operation.
Knowleadgeable people say that the depiction of naval tactics is very good.
Features shameless capitalist propaganda near the end.
Much better than other Tom Clancy books.

*Limit*, by Frank Schätzing (english franslation from German)

*Brief History of Almost Everything*, Bill Bryson - One of the best science books for the layman.
Has the best description I've ever seen of what a cell looks like "from the inside".

`Kim <https://www.amazon.com/Kim-Rudyard-Kipling/dp/1546571906>`_, by Rudyard Kipling.
Some linguistic quirks, but a nice adventure in the British Raj.
I don't recommend more well known *The Jungle Book* by the same author.

`Sharpe <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_(novel_series)>`_ series of books, by Bernard Cornwal (I haven't read them all yet) -
These books follow the (fictional) life and career of a British soldier (*Sharp*),
who accompanies the Duke of Wellington in many of his campaigns.
The books are basically an excuse to show Wellington's campaigns from the "ground level" view.

The books are divided in two groups:

* The ones set in India, with huge, epic battles but also smaller scale vignetes
  featuring the exotic landscape and culture of India.
* The ones set during the Peninsular War.
  The Peninsular War was a war fought in the Iberian Peninsula by the Portuguese, English and Spanish
  against Napoleon. The stories in these books are more small scale, and the action focuses in
  smaller groups, in contrast to the more "epic" setting of the Indian books.

I've read somewhere that the military tactics described are not always historically correct,
but the main events do happen as they did in real life.
In order to make his hero relevant, the author sometimes makes him take upon himself
actions that were take by someone else in real life.
For example:

* in a battle where no English troops fought (only Scottish troops were there in real life),
  the `Battle of Gawilghur <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Gawilghur>`_,
  the auhor contrives small English dettatchment just to have Sharpe there.
* in another book, during the Assault on the Portuguese city of OPorto, under the control of the French,
  Sharpe orders a Portuguese barber to cross the river with some barges to the English
  side, so that the English can cross.
  In real life the barber (whose name has been lost) did it all by himself.
* in yet another book, the author conjures an abandoned Portuguese frotress out of thin air, so that,
  again, geography puts Sharpe near the action.
  The fake fortress was inspired by a real one, though.

All these incorrections are explained by the author at the end of the books
(I took these examples from the books themselves).
If these little details are not a dealbreaker, the books are quite enjoyable.

`Mila 18 <https://www.amazon.com/Mila-18-Leon-Uris/dp/0553241605>`_, by Leon Uris.
Set in World War II, it tells the story of the Nazi's occupation of Poland,
focusing on the desperate guerilla fight of the Jews in the Warsaw's ghetto.
The fighting lasted for 42 days, longer than the it took the Nazis to occupy Poland.

`Armageddon <https://www.amazon.com/Armageddon-Novel-Berlin-Leon-Uris/dp/1453258396>`_, by Leon Uris.
The history of the occupation of Berlin, the  `Berlin Airlift <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Blockade>`_
and its aftermath.
Extremely racist in some parts, but overall a gripping story.

`Tai-Pan <https://www.amazon.com/Tai-Pan-Asian-Saga-James-Clavell/dp/0440184622>`_, by James Clavel.

*The Count of Montecristo*, by Alexande Dumas

`American Gods <https://www.amazon.com/American-Gods-Novel-Neil-Gaiman/dp/0062572237>`_, Neil Gaiman.
A bleak, dark portrait of the United States, especially the so-called "flyover states".
The main character is drawn to a world where *Gods*
live among mortals, largely stripped of their ancient power due to lack of belief.
The story is not particularly engaging, but the atmosphere has it's charm.
Highly explicit sexual content in some parts.

`O Homem que Sabia Contar <https://www.presenca.pt/livro/o-homem-que-sabia-contar/index.ud121?from_zone=breadcrumb>`_
(*The men who could count*),
by Malba Tahan (pseudonym), written in Portuguese.
AFAIK, there is no Eglish translation of this book, which is a shame.
The book's plot is driven by a series of math problems.
Most of the action takes place in Baghdad, just before the Mongol's conquest and destruction of the city.

`O Cavaleiro da Dinamarca <https://www.librarything.com/work/3546993>`_ (*The Dannish Knight*),
by Sophia de Mello Breyner (in Portuguese).
A very short book and an example of children's stories done right.
Again, I don't think there's an English translation.

More to come...

Medicine
++++++++

`Medical Physiology <https://www.amazon.com/Medical-Physiology-Walter-Boron-PhD/dp/1455743771>`_, Boron and Boulpaep.
Highly detailed (maybe too much for med school), but its the only book I've seen
that really explains physiology from the ground up.
The writing is excelent and the drawings are suberb.
I'll write a comprehensive review on this one when I have some time.

`Clinical Microbiology Made Ridicuously Simple <https://www.amazon.com/Clinical-Microbiology-Made-Ridiculously-Simple/dp/1935660152>`_,
by William Trattler. Great for Medical Students, bad for everyone else.
Tries to teach microbiology and the basics of infectiology based on weird mnemonics and drawings.
The text itself is very good, although it might be a little too simple.
But in a subject like microbiology, if you know everything in that book, it'll be more than enough.

Non-Fiction
~~~~~~~~~~~


`How the Mind Works <https://www.amazon.com/How-Mind-Works-Steven-Pinker/dp/0393334775>`_, Steven Pinker

`Bad Science <https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Science-Quacks-Pharma-Flacks/dp/0865479186>`_, by Ben Goldacre.
Should be required reading for all medical students and doctors.

`Bad Pharma <https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Pharma-Companies-Mislead-Patients/dp/0865478066>`_, by Ben Goldacre.
As above. This one was actually hard to finish.
It gets kind of disgusting after a while, in the same way that *Schindler's List*
gets disgusting.

`Life of Bryan <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079470/>`_, by the Monty Python.

`Lord of the Rings <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/>`_, by Peter Jackson.
if you've never seen these movies, do so.
Hardcore tolkien fans will complain it's not faithful wnough to the books,
but they actually managed do make a good series of movies.
The movies are certainly different from the books, but they're probably
the best thing you can do given the time constraints available to the medium.

`Tora! Tora! Tora! <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066473/>`_,
directed by Richard Fleischer (American sequences), Kinji Fukasaku 
and Toshio Masuda	(Japanese sequences).
The story of the attack of Pearl Harbour.
Extremely well done.
The movie was directed and filmed by two distinct teams:
a Japanese team that directed the parts told from the point of view of the Japanese and
and American team that directed the part told from the point of view of the Americans.
The best special effects I've probably seen in any movie
(it helps that the planes are real planes and the boats are real boats).
This is probably my favourite movie ever.

`Snatch <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208092/>`_, Guy Ritchie.
Somewhat violent but actually quite lighthearted.
Even if the beginning doesn't seem very good, please keep watching
untill the end. It's worth it.
Plays hard and fast with vehicle collision physics.

`Ben Hur (1959) <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052618/>`_, William Wyler.´
An epic movie, set around the time of the death of Jesus Christ.
A little too long, and the end, in which we witnes the torture and death of Christ
feels a little  forced and detatched from the main storyline.
Based on a the book
`Ben-Hur: a Tale of the Christ <https://www.amazon.com/Ben-Hur-Tale-Christ-Complete-Unabridged/dp/1617203408>`_
by Lew Wallace.
Like *The Lord of The Rings*, the book and the movie
are different beasts, and both are worth it in their own way.
The book focuses more on the *christian* side of the story,
while the movie focueses on the *jeweish* side.

`Mississipi Burning <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095647/>`_, directed by Alan Parker.

`The Prestige <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/>`_, directed by Christopher Nolan.
Tells the story of the rivalry between two illusionists.
I can't tell anything else becaus it might be a spoiler.
Please, do not discuss this movie with anyone prior to watching it.

`Enigma (2001) <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157583/>`_, directed by Michael Apted.
It's a 100% fake story, inspired by the real events at Bletchley Park during World War II.
The main character is a thinly veiled copy of Alan Turing, except he has a different name and is straight.
Dispite being completely fake, the depiction of the code breaking operation
matches what I've read in reputable sources.
This is the best fictional depiction I've ever seen.
I can't say that the movie respects *the letter* of History, but it certainly respects *the spirit*.

I absolutely **do not** recommend `The Imitation Game <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/>`_.
This one is a movie that claims to represent the Truth, but it ends up
a confused mess that neither represents *the letter* nor *the spirit*.
Apparenty all *geniuses* must be socially awkward and borderline autistic.
Also, the code breaking operation was 8 guys and a woman in a barn,
with a one-eyed Navy veteran checking up on them occasionally.
There's `a website <http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/based-on-a-true-true-story/>`_
that rates some "based on a true story" movies according to how true they were to reality.
*The Imitation Game* has the distincion of being the only one with a rating under 50%.
The movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Oh, wait...
They made Turing gay! I guess that must count for something.
