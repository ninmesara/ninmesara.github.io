About
=====

I am a young doctor who likes to talk about stuff.
I started this blog to see if also like to *write* about things.

The name of this blog comes from Nin-Me-Sa-Ra, a group of Ancient Sumerian
religious hymns, written by the priestess Enheduanna.
They are part of the first texts in which the author's name is known.
A blog is always a little exercise of vanity
(even when written under a pseudonym), and I think it makes sense
to name it after the works of the first known author in history.
