I plan on covering a number of topics.
I might split or join some of those topics if I feel it makes more sense that way.
In that case I'll update this index.

Don't expect textbook ready content...
That needs a serious time investment, the help of a professional editor,
and given the breadth of what I'm trying to cover, a team of co-authors.
While I do have a plan, I might scrape parts of it or rewrite it furiously
if it doesn't work well.

I'll try to keep a regular schedule I'm comfortable with,
but it might take some time until such schedule emerges.
I appreciate reader feedback enormously, and I accept reader's
suggestions for topics they might wish to see covered.
To cover some of these topics appropriately, I will need to do some reading
of my own, 

The goal here is to be informative in a way that is understandable to laymen,
but I think some medical students or even doctors might benefit from reading.
I will try to bring in something new, because there's no need to parrot
stuff that's easily available elsewhere.

The focus here is more on understanding the human body, both in health and disease
as well as some selected topics about the practice of Medicine which I think
might be interesting for non medical readers.
I won't focus much on actionable medical advice.
In fact, I don't think I'll ever give much medical advice except for the
*Three Mighty Pillars Of Healthy Living*:

1. Stop smoking!
2. Stop smoking!
3. Stop smoking!

For people who do not smoke, the *Three Pillars* are:

1. Don't start.
2. Don't start.
3. Don't feel too smug for never having started.
